This is a small personal project I wokred on in my spare time. The idea came to me in a dream, strangely enough, and I thought it was simple enough but also branches out of my comfort zone a little, so I decided it would make a good addition to my skillset. It has taught me about Unity's shaders, Unity's particel sysem and a form of procedural generation, with weighted probabilites. The 3D physics was also new to me, so that was a fun challenge to get working and I'm very happy with how they turned out.

The inspirations, I belive as it did sort of come from nowhere, are subway surfers and geomtry dash. Taking the endless runner genre from the former and the style (although I did make it 3D) from the latter.

It works on both PC and mobile, since I wanted to be able to play this while idling out and about.
